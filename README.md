Prof, if you're readin this, i hope you start code something with some senses, cause this it's giving me headache only trying to understand this.
after this has been said, I'll go dying in this freaking code trying to work something out.
This code should simulate a dump with WPF and C#, the most of it is already done but there are some things to adjust/implement.
Main things to do:
- graphic's adjustements
- add organic, plastic, glass shelters
- the camions have to dissappear after a random time; time that has to be saved and showed up in the tool bar (average time)

And that should be it, but it's easier to say than to do it :/
Good luck to everyone who is brave enough!
